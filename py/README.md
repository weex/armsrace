armsrace - Generative Adversarial Agents
(based on the engine from ebokai/particle_game_of_life)

Creating a predator-prey relationship between Generative Adversarial Agents.

The first step is to prune this simulation down to two populations of nodes:
* d for predator
* y for prey

Then we will introduce two random populations of animals with random genomes. Both will need to eat in order to live and reproduce. The difference will be what they consider to be food.
